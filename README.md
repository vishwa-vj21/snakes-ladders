Snakes and Ladders Game

Overview

This is a digital version of the classic board game "Snakes and Ladders" implemented using Python with Tkinter for the GUI and Pygame for sound effects. The game supports two players and follows standard rules, incorporating smooth animations and realistic movement effects.

Features

🎲 Dice Roll Simulation: Players roll a virtual dice to move forward on the board.

🐍 Snakes: If a player lands on a snake's head, they slide down to the tail.

🪜 Ladders: If a player lands on a ladder, they smoothly climb to a higher position.

🎵 Sound Effects: Includes rolling dice sounds, movement sounds, snake bite effects, and ladder climbing sounds.

🏆 Winning Condition: The first player to reach exactly 100 wins the game.

🖼 Graphical Interface: A visually appealing board with animated player movement.

How to Play

Run the Python script to start the game.

Players take turns rolling the dice by clicking the "Roll Dice" button.

The player moves step-by-step unless they land on a ladder, in which case they move instantly.

If a player lands on a snake, they disappear momentarily and reappear at the snake's tail.

The first player to reach 100 wins!
